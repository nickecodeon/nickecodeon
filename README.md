## Hi there 👋

I'm Nick, a computer science student from Germany aspiring to become a full-stack engineer.

I enjoy building modern applications that solve real-world problems,
with a focus on clean architecture and continuous learning.

So far, I have been working with a variety of technologies, including React and Java for full-stack development, as well as Python and C++ for solving complex problems and experimenting with algorithms.
